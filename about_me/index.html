        <p>Hello! My name is Ian Hatcher. I am currently a student who really should be looking for a job.
            I like programing, and I tend to spend most of my time reading or playing games. I also write 
            when i can convince myself to do so, and people tell me its good. I tend to move a lot. I have 
            been in the church my whole life, and my parents have been too.
        </p>
