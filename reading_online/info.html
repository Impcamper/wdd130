            <p>There are a ton of badly written stuff because you don’t need an editor to post online, this means that stories online can vary quite wildly. So while some stories are have next to no errors, there also exist stories that have no internal consistency, or the ability to be coherent. Second is the piles of unfinished stories. Most stories online don’t reach completion, for a good variety of reasons. While a few stories do mange to get completed, most stories will be either in progress or left unfinished forever. This doesn’t mean these unfinished stories aren’t worth reading, just be prepared to wait for updates or be disappointed when one ends prematurely. A third thing is a lot of stories will tend to be stories based on existing shows or books, often called fanfiction. There still are original stories, but fanfiction makes up the majority of the stories. Of course there is a great variety in how different stories use the source marital, with some stories staying very close to the original story, while others might only be barely connected doing something very different. (might want to expand on these individually.)</p>
