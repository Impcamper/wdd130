Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <h3>Main idea</h1>
      Main landing page. Not quite sure what I want to have on here, but it is important as it is the first page anyone who visits the website will see. I know I will want to have some sort of image front and center, and the links to the other two pages. Don’t think having a head bar though, or one with just the home link. Probably just the home link head bar as it would look nice. Don’t want to have a lot of text on this page, hero-text intro thing, and short 1 sentence explanation for each link.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="images/pages.jpg" alt="image for homepage">
        <img src="#" alt="image for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>Info</h3>
      <p>
        <h3>Info page idea</h3>
        Information page would contain all the informational stuff, split up by header and the main information pertaining to that header. I would want to have an image at the top before the paragraphs so that the reader isn’t immediately bombarded with loads of text. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Main info</h3>
        There are a ton of badly written stuff because you don’t need an editor to post online, this means that stories online can vary quite wildly. So while some stories are have next to no errors, there also exist stories that have no internal consistency, or the ability to be coherent. Second is the piles of unfinished stories. Most stories online don’t reach completion, for a good variety of reasons. While a few stories do mange to get completed, most stories will be either in progress or left unfinished forever. This doesn’t mean these unfinished stories aren’t worth reading, just be prepared to wait for updates or be disappointed when one ends prematurely. A third thing is a lot of stories will tend to be stories based on existing shows or books, often called fanfiction. There still are original stories, but fanfiction makes up the majority of the stories. Of course there is a great variety in how different stories use the source marital, with some stories staying very close to the original story, while others might only be barely connected doing something very different. (might want to expand on these individually.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Quality</h3>
        Most stories online are going to range from okay to bad, with only a few great ones. While this is true of books too, online the ratio of bad stories to great stories is far greater because they don’t have a minimum quality level that needs to be met. This ratio also differs depending on the website the story is from due to different websites having different cultures. An example of differing cultures would be games in bay12 vs sufficient velocity, in bay12 they tend to be group games where with multiple people playing different characters, while sufficient velocity tends to run games where everyone controls the same character and have to vote on what to do next. (might be a bit of a tangent and needs the end cut off, just leaving it at the culture part)

      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Links</h3>
        (Putting links to places that host stories is probably a good idea, but I don’t know if it should get it’s own page or be part of an existing page.) Example of places that have stories on them. Fanfiction.net, archive of our own, wattpad, online forums like sufficient velocity and spacebattles. (Would separate them into different lines, and maybe give a bit of info about each website)
